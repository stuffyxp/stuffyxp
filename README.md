hello there! :3

i'm StuffyXP (alternatively just **Stuffy**), im just your average tech youtuber and webdev, im mostly interested in other things like games and linux! 
(*if you want to see a more detailed about me, i'd suggest visiting [the about page on my website!](<https://stuffyxp.github.io/about/>)*)

also yes i'm the guy who once broke linux by just installing docker... 

or broke the windows vista taskbar by just resizing it... 

or the 🅰️ guy (yes i really thought it was a shouting emoji not the blood type)... 

but we don't talk about that over here

and yes i used to change my website's layout every month, i promise i won't do that for a while i promise i promise


i also have a [youtube channel](<https://stuffyxp.github.io/go/youtube-stuffy/>), [fedi account](<https://stuffyxp.github.io/go/mastodon>) and a [discord server](<https://stuffyxp.github.io/go/discord>)! (if you want to visit them just click on the names of the service or smth whatever)

feel free to view the type of shit that i have around here i dunno ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
