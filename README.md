Hello, world! 👋

I'm Stuffy, formely known as StuffyXP, i'm a little doggy who likes to mess around with tech, i have a YouTube channel with over 70 subscribers and great friends on Discord! 👀

My (chaotic) curiosity bring me here, as like doing random things that i'm interested, which you may guessed now, one of these is coding! 💞️

I'm learning HTML and CSS, as i (with the help of my friend [Lynx](<https://github.com/Lynxmic>)) i'm making my own website! just as a little neat introduction page by me to the internet 🌱 

If you even wish to contact me on the internet, you easily can by reaching me out on the Fediverse! my account is [@stuffyxp@wetdry.world](<https://wetdry.world/@stuffyxp>)!

My pronouns are he / him, but if you'd like to call me they / them, you can do it, i don't mind 😄

Random fun fact: I learned aff of my computing skills when i was 3 years old, i'm 13 and i can code, that ain't normal! ⚡
